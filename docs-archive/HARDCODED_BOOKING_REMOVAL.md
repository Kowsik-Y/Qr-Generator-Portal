# Removed Hardcoded Book Slot Section

## Issue
Even after implementing conditional test access logic, a **hardcoded "Book Test Slot" section** was still appearing for ALL tests (instant, timed, and booking) at the bottom of the page.

## Root Cause
There were **TWO separate** booking implementations in the file:

### 1. ✅ **Correct Implementation** (Lines 467-597)
- Conditional rendering based on `test?.test_type`
- Shows ONLY for `test_type === 'booking'`
- Integrated with test data
- Part of the main test action buttons

### 2. ❌ **Hardcoded Section** (Lines 652-753) - REMOVED
- **Always visible** regardless of test type
- Used hardcoded demo data (`availableSlot` object)
- Appeared below Materials section
- Caused confusion for users

## What Was Removed

### 1. Hardcoded Data Object (Lines 145-152)
```typescript
// ❌ REMOVED - Demo/hardcoded data
const availableSlot = {
  date: 'Oct 20, 2025',
  instructor: 'Test Instructor',
  topic: test?.title || 'Test Session',
  times: ['10:00 AM - 11:00 AM', '2:00 PM - 3:00 PM', '4:00 PM - 5:00 PM'],
  seats: 30,
  booked: 18,
};
```

### 2. Hardcoded UI Section (Lines 652-753)
```typescript
// ❌ REMOVED - Always visible booking section
<View className="mb-6">
  <Text className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
    Book Test Slot
  </Text>
  <View className="rounded-xl p-6">
    {/* Topic, instructor, date */}
    {/* Time dropdown */}
    {/* Available seats */}
    {/* "Book It" button */}
  </View>
</View>
```

## File Changes

### File: `native/app/(tabs)/test-details.tsx`

**Lines Removed:**
- Lines 145-152: `availableSlot` hardcoded object
- Lines 652-753: Entire "Book Test Slot" UI section

**Total Lines Removed:** ~110 lines

## Current Implementation

Now the page has **ONLY ONE** booking implementation:

```typescript
{/* ONLY SHOWS FOR BOOKING TESTS */}
{test?.test_type === 'booking' && (
  <View className="gap-3">
    {/* Slot picker */}
    <Picker>...</Picker>
    
    {/* Book Slot button */}
    <Pressable>Book Slot</Pressable>
    
    {/* Take Test button */}
    <Pressable>Take Test</Pressable>
  </View>
)}
```

## Page Structure Now

### Test Details Page Layout
1. **Header** - Test title, back button
2. **Test Info Card** - Duration, marks, type badge, department
3. **Action Buttons** (Conditional based on role and test type)
   - **Teachers/Admins**: Edit, Delete, Add Materials, Add Questions, View Questions
   - **Students**:
     - **Instant Test**: "Take Test" button
     - **Timed Test**: Time window messages
     - **Booking Test**: Slot picker + "Book Slot" + "Take Test"
4. **Materials Section** - Course materials
5. ~~**Book Slot Section**~~ ❌ REMOVED

## Benefits

### 1. **Eliminates Confusion**
- Students no longer see two different booking interfaces
- Clear which action to take based on test type

### 2. **Cleaner Code**
- Removed ~110 lines of redundant code
- Single source of truth for booking UI
- No hardcoded demo data

### 3. **Consistent UX**
- All test type logic in one place
- Proper conditional rendering
- No conflicting UI elements

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Only one booking implementation to maintain
- Changes apply consistently
- Less code to test

## Testing Verification

### ✅ Instant Test
- Navigate to test details
- Should see: "Take Test" button only
- Should NOT see: "Book Test Slot" section
- Should NOT see: Slot picker

### ✅ Timed Test
- Navigate to test details
- Should see: Time window messages
- Should NOT see: "Book Test Slot" section
- Should NOT see: Slot picker (outside conditional)

### ✅ Booking Test
- Navigate to test details
- Should see: Slot picker (inside conditional)
- Should see: "Book Slot" button
- Should see: "Take Test" button
- Should NOT see: Separate "Book Test Slot" section

### ✅ All Test Types
- Scroll to bottom of page
- Should see: Materials section
- Should NOT see: "Book Test Slot" heading
- Should NOT see: Hardcoded slot times

## Migration Note

### Why This Hardcoded Section Existed
This was likely:
1. **Demo/prototype code** from initial development
2. **Template code** copied from a booking example
3. **Forgotten during refactoring** when conditional logic was added

### No Data Loss
- No actual booking data was stored with this section
- Was purely UI/demo code
- Real booking functionality is in the conditional section

## Comparison

### Before (2 Implementations)
```
Test Details Page:
├── Header
├── Info Card
├── Action Buttons
│   └── (Conditional booking UI) ✅ Correct
├── Materials Section
└── Book Test Slot Section ❌ Always visible
    ├── Hardcoded data
    └── "Book It" button
```

### After (1 Implementation)
```
Test Details Page:
├── Header
├── Info Card
├── Action Buttons
│   └── (Conditional booking UI) ✅ Only source
└── Materials Section
```

## Prevention

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Check for duplicate UI implementations
- [ ] Remove hardcoded demo/test data before production
- [ ] Ensure only one source of truth for each feature
- [ ] Use conditional rendering consistently
- [ ] Remove unused variables/constants

### Best Practices
1. **Single Source of Truth**: One implementation per feature
2. **Conditional Rendering**: All variations in one place
3. **No Hardcoded Data**: Use API data or props
4. **Clean Up**: Remove demo code after testing
