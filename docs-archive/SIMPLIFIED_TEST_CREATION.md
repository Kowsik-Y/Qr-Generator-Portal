# ✨ Simplified Test Creation Flow

## What Changed

### Before ❌
- Test creation form had **Materials Selection** section
- Test creation form had **Questions Builder** section
- Complex multi-step process in one page
- User had to add everything at once

### After ✅
- **Simplified test creation** - only basic test details
- Clean, focused UI
- Add materials and questions **after** test is created
- Two-step workflow: Create → Enhance

## New User Flow

```
1. Create Test (Basic Details Only)
   ├── Title
   ├── Description
   ├── Question Type (MCQ/Code/Mixed)
   ├── Availability Type (Instant/Booking/Timed)
   ├── Duration, Passing Score, Total Marks
   ├── Platform Restriction
   └── Time Window (if timed)
   
   ↓ Click "Create Test"
   
2. Success Dialog Shows Two Options:
   ├── "Add Materials & Questions" → Go to Test Details Page
   └── "Back to Course" → Return to Course Details
   
3. Test Details Page (if user chose to add materials/questions)
   ├── View Test Info
   ├── [Add Materials to Test] Button ← Teachers/Admins
   ├── [Add Questions] Button ← Teachers/Admins
   └── [Take Test] Button ← Students
```

   - Title: "Midterm Exam"
   - Type: MCQ
   - Duration: 90 min
5. Click "Create Test"
```

### Step 2: Add Materials
```
6. Click "Add Materials & Questions" in success dialog

8. Upload PDF, videos, links, code snippets
9. Materials appear in test details
```

### Step 3: Add Questions
```
10. In test details page, click "Add Questions"
11. Create MCQ or coding questions
12. Set marks, options, correct answers
13. Questions ready for students
```

## Info Note in UI

A helpful note is displayed on the create test page:

```
💡 Note: After creating the test, you'll be able to add 
materials and questions from the test details page.
```

## Validation

### Client-Side Validation
- ✅ Course ID required
- ✅ Title cannot be empty
- ✅ Duration must be at least 1 minute
- ✅ Valid number inputs for duration, passing score, total marks

### Server-Side Validation (from previous fix)
- ✅ Handles empty timestamp strings (converts to null)
- ✅ created_by field handled safely
- ✅ Required fields validated

## API Call

### Simplified Request
```typescript
const testResponse = await testAPI.create({
  course_id: courseId!,
  title: testData.title,
  description: testData.description,
  quiz_type: testData.quiz_type,
  test_type: testData.test_type,
  duration_minutes: testData.duration_minutes,
  passing_score: testData.passing_score,
  total_marks: testData.total_marks,
  platform_restriction: testData.platform_restriction,
  start_time: testData.start_time,
  end_time: testData.end_time
});
```

No complex loops, no question creation, no material linking - just clean test creation!
